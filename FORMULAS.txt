formulas for probability calculation

1) hits_count_mult_success_percent
    player_scoring_probability = ASN * SP

    ASN: Average amount of shoots on goal
    SP: Percent of successive shoots

2) match_based_probabilities
    player_scoring_probability = (GS / GP) * ZRS * 100

    GS: number of games player scored
    GP: number of games player played
    ZRS: current amount of streak of games player didn't scored
    100: percentage multiplier

3) player_stat_with_teams_factor
    player_scoring_probability = (ASN * SP) + ATH - (ETD / 5.0)

    ASN: Average amount of shoots on goal
    SP: Percent of successive shoots
    ATH: Ally team help index (sum of (PPI - NPI) for each player)
        PPI: positive participation on ice by radegast index
        NPI: negative participation on ice by radegast index
    ETD: Enemy team defence index (sum of (ZS / Z) for each player)
        ZS: blocked shoots for all games
        Z: Games played
    5.0: is to normalize ETD
